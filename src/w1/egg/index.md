MISSING: One sculpture 
(one monumental enigma, one community cornerstone, one _egg_ceptional mystery)

## Have You Seen Me?
We are looking for any **photographs** or **information** on the whereabouts of the **Gerrard Square egg sculpture**. 

We refuse to let “The Egg” be scrambled from our history. We have reconstructed an approximation of this communal treasure from memory and legend.

[ARTISTIC INTERPRETATION]

**Description:** Two bronze hands holding a tremendous egg, magnificent in size. A metal marvel with a gnarly texture. 

**Last known sighting:** Gerrard Square shopping mall, pre-renovation (2003?)

Please help spread the word. Ignite conversations with anyone who's ever called Gerrard Square a landmark in their lives. Dive into the nostalgia with your family, reconnect with long-lost friends, and share the legend of “The Egg.”

"The egg,” as it was affectionately called, was a community emblem. It is perhaps known best as the location everyone would instruct you to meet at when visiting the mall. This local landmark status made “the egg” a great symbol of eggalitarianism among the community.

## WE NEED YOUR HELP
But as you dig through your archives and memory banks, consider this: Why are there no remaining photos of such an imposing figure? Why has the Egg, a beacon in the bustling hub of Gerrard Square, vanished without leaving a trace in the digital world?

If you possess or discover any imagery of “The Egg,” understand the gravity of what you hold. You have in your hands a piece of our collective soul, a fragment of a past that powerful forces wish to remain hidden.

Take heed, the keepers of this precious proof are urged to safeguard it with their lives. When they realize you have the key to unveiling the truth, you must be ready. Your bravery is the beacon in our search for “The Egg.”

When the day comes that “The Egg” emerges from the shadows, all will be revealed. Your sacrifice will be remembered. Your courage will become legend.

## Conspiracy of Silence
What they want is for “The Egg” to be forgotten. You can help protect The Egg’s legacy by spreading the word. Tell your parents, your siblings, your former childhood best friend that you lost contact with beyond a random Facebook friend request from 2012.

There are no known photographs of “the egg.” We can only determine that this is part of a clandestine campaign to destroy its legacy and cause further division among our community.

### Mystery

What if the egg... hatched?
What if, in a twist that defies belief, the Egg wasn't just a static sculpture? What if it was... alive? What if it hatched?

Think about it. A giant egg, held aloft by steadfast hands, suddenly gone as if it never existed. Not a single photograph left behind in an age where even the most mundane moments are captured and archived. Doesn't it seem like something—or someone—wants to erase its existence?

They can't scramble our memories.

The silence surrounding the Egg's disappearance is deafening. It's as though there's a concerted effort to scrub it from our history. But why? What secret does the Egg hold? What power lurks within its bronzed shell that they're so desperate to keep hidden?

We're calling on the true believers, the seekers of secrets, the protectors of the past. Help us uncover the truth.

HATCH THE TRUTH

The SPLA may be small, but our resolve is mighty. We won't be dissuaded by the naysayers or those who tell us to forget. The Egg's legacy is our mission, and we will pursue it with every ounce of our being.

Join us as we delve into the mystery of Gerrard Square's Egg. Spread the word, share your clues, and stand with us as we unravel this enigma. Together, we can crack the case wide open.
